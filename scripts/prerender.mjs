 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * AI Nexus is a React SPA deployed on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a pure
 * static host — it only serves files that actually exist on disk. When Google
 * or Bing crawl /tools/rytr, GitHub Pages looks for dist/tools/rytr/index.html,
 * finds nothing, and returns HTTP 404. A 404 response cannot be indexed,
 * regardless of what JavaScript does afterwards.
 *
 * This script runs after `vite build` and creates a real index.html file for
 * every route, each with:
 *   • Correct <title>, <meta description>, canonical URL
 *   • Open Graph + Twitter Card tags
 *   • Schema.org JSON-LD (Review, Article, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage, etc.)
 *
 * Result: every URL returns HTTP 200 with crawlable HTML. React then hydrates
 * on the client side for the interactive experience.

const TOOL_FAQS = {
  rytr: [
    { q: 'Is Rytr really free?', a: "Yes. Rytr's free plan gives you 10,000 characters per month — enough to write 3–4 short blog posts or 20+ social media captions. No credit card required to sign up." },
    { q: 'How does Rytr compare to ChatGPT?', a: 'ChatGPT is more flexible for conversation and complex tasks. Rytr is faster for specific writing jobs like ad copy, bios, and outlines — it has 40+ pre-built use cases. For $9/month unlimited, Rytr is far better value if you write structured content regularly.' },
    { q: 'Does Rytr work in languages other than English?', a: 'Yes — Rytr supports 30+ languages including Hindi, Spanish, French, German, and Arabic. The quality in non-English languages is solid for short-form content.' },
    { q: "What is Rytr's affiliate commission?", a: 'Rytr pays 30% recurring commission. That means if someone you refer stays subscribed, you earn 30% of their monthly payment every single month — indefinitely.' },
    { q: 'Can Rytr write full blog posts?', a: 'Rytr can write blog outlines, intros, and sections, but the free and Saver plans limit output length. For full 1,500+ word articles, the Unlimited plan at $29/month works, or a dedicated tool like Writesonic.' },
  ],
  podcastle: [
    { q: 'Is Podcastle free to use?', a: "Yes. Podcastle's free plan lets you record and edit podcasts with basic features. The main limitation is export quality and total recording minutes. For starting a first show or low-volume podcasting, the free plan is genuinely functional." },
    { q: 'How does Podcastle compare to Descript?', a: 'Podcastle is better for recording — especially remote interviews with guests. Descript is better for heavy text-based editing of existing audio. If you record first then edit, Podcastle is the better starting point and it\'s cheaper than Descript too.' },
    { q: 'Can Podcastle remove background noise automatically?', a: "Yes. Podcastle's AI noise removal is one of its best features — it removes keyboard clicks, air conditioning hum, echo, and room noise in one click. I've tested it on recordings made in a noisy apartment and the results are impressive." },
    { q: 'What is the Revoice feature?', a: "Revoice lets you clone your voice and fix mistakes in your recording without re-recording. If you mispronounced a word or said 'um', you type the correction and Revoice generates it in your voice. It's the most useful feature for solo podcasters." },
    { q: 'Does Podcastle publish directly to Spotify?', a: "Yes — Podcastle has direct publishing to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other major platforms built into paid plans. You don't need a separate podcast hosting service." },
  ],
  ocoya: [
    { q: 'What platforms does Ocoya schedule to?', a: 'Ocoya supports Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and Google Business Profile. You can create one post and schedule it across all platforms simultaneously.' },
    { q: 'How does Ocoya compare to Buffer or Hootsuite?', a: "Ocoya is significantly cheaper than Hootsuite and adds AI content generation that Buffer lacks. Buffer is better for detailed analytics. Hootsuite is better for large agency teams with multiple clients. For solo creators and small businesses, Ocoya offers the best value." },
    { q: 'Can Ocoya write captions automatically?', a: "Yes — Ocoya's AI caption generator writes platform-specific captions based on your topic, product, or brief. It understands the difference between LinkedIn's professional tone and Instagram's casual voice." },
    { q: 'Is there a free plan for Ocoya?', a: "Ocoya offers a free trial but no permanent free plan. Paid plans start at $15/month. At that price it replaces a standalone caption writer ($10–15/month) plus a scheduler ($10–15/month) — so it actually saves money." },
    { q: 'Does Ocoya include graphic design tools?', a: "Yes — Ocoya has a built-in visual creator for making social media graphics. It's not as powerful as Canva for complex designs, but for standard social posts many users find they don't need Canva at all after switching to Ocoya." },
  ],
  replit: [
    { q: 'Do I need to install anything to use Replit?', a: "No. Replit works entirely in your browser. No downloads, no local setup, no configuring Node.js or Python environments. You open a browser tab and start coding immediately. This is Replit's biggest advantage for beginners." },
    { q: 'What coding languages does Replit support?', a: 'Replit supports 50+ languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and more. You can switch between languages instantly without installing anything on your machine.' },
    { q: "How does Replit's AI compare to GitHub Copilot?", a: "Replit's AI (Ghostwriter) understands the context of your entire project — not just the current file. For beginners and solo projects it's very useful. GitHub Copilot integrates better into professional IDEs like VS Code for experienced developers." },
    { q: 'Can I host my app on Replit for free?', a: "Yes — Replit's free plan gives you a public URL for every project instantly. The free hosting has limits on RAM and always-on uptime. The Core plan ($7/month) removes most limits and is excellent value for indie projects." },
    { q: 'Is Replit good for learning to code from scratch?', a: "Replit is one of the best environments to learn coding in 2026. The zero-setup experience eliminates the frustration that stops most beginners. The AI assistant explains errors in plain language. Starting with Python on Replit is currently one of the fastest paths to writing real, working code." },
  ],
  taskade: [
    { q: 'What makes Taskade different from Notion or Asana?', a: "Taskade combines task management + team chat + video calls + AI agents in one tool. Notion is better for documents and wikis. Asana is better for large enterprise project management. Taskade is the best all-in-one for small teams and freelancers who don't want 4 separate subscriptions." },
    { q: 'What are Taskade AI agents?', a: "Taskade lets you build custom AI agents that automate your specific workflows. For example: an agent that takes a client brief and automatically creates a full project plan with tasks and deadlines. These agents run autonomously and can save 30–60 minutes per new project." },
    { q: "Is Taskade's free plan actually useful?", a: "Yes — unlike many tools where the free plan is just a limited demo, Taskade's free tier gives you real access to AI features, projects, and collaboration. A small team of 2–3 people can operate effectively on the free plan." },
    { q: 'Does Taskade have a mobile app?', a: "Yes, Taskade has iOS and Android apps. The desktop experience is significantly better than mobile — the mobile app is functional but complex features like building AI agents work better on a computer or tablet." },
    { q: 'What is the Taskade affiliate commission rate?', a: "Taskade pays 30% recurring commission for the lifetime of the customer. This means every person you refer continues generating 30% commission on their subscription each month, indefinitely." },
  ],
  grammarly: [
    { q: 'Is Grammarly free?', a: "Yes — Grammarly's free plan covers basic grammar, spelling, and punctuation checks. It works across Gmail, Google Docs, and most web apps via the browser extension. Premium unlocks tone detection, clarity rewrites, and plagiarism checking." },
    { q: 'How accurate is Grammarly?', a: "For standard business and academic writing, Grammarly's accuracy is excellent — better than Microsoft Word's built-in checker. It occasionally over-corrects creative writing by applying formal grammar rules to intentional stylistic choices." },
    { q: 'Does Grammarly work internationally?', a: "Yes — Grammarly works globally via browser extension and desktop app across Gmail, Google Docs, Word, and 500+ other apps. It's effective in any country and supports American, British, Canadian, and Australian English style preferences." },

      { q: 'What is the cheapest AI writing tool between Rytr and Writesonic?', a: 'Rytr is significantly cheaper. The Rytr Saver plan is $9/month for unlimited words. Writesonic\'s comparable plan starts at $16/month and includes word count limits depending on your plan tier.' },
      { q: 'Does Rytr have a free plan?', a: 'Yes. Rytr\'s free plan gives 10,000 characters per month — enough to test the tool properly before committing to a paid plan.' },
      { q: 'Can Writesonic write full blog posts?', a: 'Yes. Writesonic\'s Article Writer generates full 1,500–2,500 word drafts with SEO optimisation built in. This is one of Writesonic\'s strongest advantages over Rytr, which requires manual assembly for long-form content.' },
      { q: 'Which AI writing tool is better for freelancers on a budget?', a: 'Rytr at $9/month unlimited is the better starting point for budget-conscious freelancers worldwide.

QuillBot is a paraphrasing and rewriting tool for restructuring existing text. If you write original content, use Grammarly. If you rewrite or summarise content regularly, use QuillBot.' },
      { q: 'Can I use both Grammarly and QuillBot together?', a: 'Yes — and many writers do. Use Grammarly while drafting (for grammar and tone feedback), and QuillBot when you need to rephrase or simplify sections. They complement each other rather than overlap.' },
      { q: 'Is QuillBot free?', a: 'QuillBot has a functional free plan with 125-word paraphrasing, a summariser, and a citation generator. Premium is $9.95/month and unlocks all 7 paraphrasing modes and higher word limits.' },
      { q: 'Is Grammarly worth paying for?', a: 'The premium plan ($12/month) is worth it if writing is central to your work. The tone detection, clarity rewrites, and engagement scoring meaningfully reduce editing time for emails, reports, and content.' },
      { q: 'Which is better for students, Grammarly or QuillBot?', a: 'QuillBot is more directly useful for most students — the free paraphraser, citation generator (APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard), and summariser cover the core academic writing needs.

Its Magic Dust AI audio enhancement is best-in-class for noise removal. Descript is better for transcript-based editing, video podcasts, and bulk filler-word removal across long interviews.' },
      { q: 'Does Podcastle record remote guests?', a: 'Yes. Podcastle records each participant locally on their own device and uploads separate high-quality audio tracks. This means recording quality doesn\'t depend on internet connection stability during the call.' },
      { q: 'What is Descript\'s text-based editing?', a: 'Descript transcribes your recording and lets you edit audio or video by editing the text transcript — delete a word in the transcript and the corresponding audio clip is deleted automatically. This makes cutting filler words and restructuring interviews very fast.' },
      { q: 'Is Podcastle free?', a: 'Yes. Podcastle\'s free plan includes unlimited recordings, up to 10 hours of Magic Dust AI enhancement per month, and remote recording for up to 10 participants. Paid plans start at $11.99/month.' },

    faqs: [
      { q: 'Is Leonardo.ai better than Midjourney?', a: 'They excel at different things. Midjourney produces the highest aesthetic quality for one-off images — painterly, cinematic outputs that other tools struggle to match. Leonardo.ai gives you far more control: 150+ fine-tuned models, custom model training, and a canvas editor. For consistent brand or character visuals across many images, Leonardo.ai wins. For single standout images where quality is everything, Midjourney wins.' },
      { q: 'Does Leonardo.ai have a free plan?', a: 'Yes. Leonardo.ai\'s free plan gives 150 tokens per day — roughly 30–40 standard images per day. Commercial use is permitted on the free plan, which is more permissive than Midjourney\'s free-tier policy. Midjourney has no permanent free plan; subscriptions start at $10/month.' },
      { q: 'Can I use Leonardo.ai images commercially?', a: 'Yes. Paid plan users have full commercial rights to generated images. Free plan users also have commercial usage rights for outputs, though terms should be confirmed in Leonardo\'s current license.

This is the most practical way to generate a recurring character or product that looks the same across many different images.' },

GitHub Copilot is an AI autocomplete assistant that works inside existing IDEs like VS Code. If you\'re a beginner or building side projects, Replit is more useful. If you\'re a professional developer already in VS Code, Copilot is what you actually want.' },
      { q: 'Does Replit have a free plan?', a: 'Yes. Replit\'s free plan includes unlimited public projects, 3 private projects, and basic Ghostwriter AI features. Paid plans start at $7/month and unlock more compute, unlimited private projects, and advanced AI agent features. GitHub Copilot has no permanent free plan — it costs $10/month for individuals, with free access available through GitHub Education for students and verified open-source contributors.' },
      { q: 'Can Replit replace GitHub Copilot?', a: 'Not directly. Replit is a complete coding environment; GitHub Copilot is a plugin for existing environments. If you use VS Code with a local development setup, Copilot integrates into that workflow — Replit cannot. If you want a browser-based environment with AI assistance included, Replit covers that use case entirely.' },
      { q: 'What is Replit Ghostwriter?', a: 'Ghostwriter is Replit\'s built-in AI coding assistant. It provides code completion, debugging help, code explanation, and an AI agent that can execute multi-step tasks across your project — such as adding a feature, refactoring code, or fixing all errors in a file. Unlike GitHub Copilot, Ghostwriter has access to your entire project context, not just the current file.' },
      { q: 'Which AI coding tool is best for learning to code?', a: 'Replit is significantly better for learning. The browser-based environment eliminates the setup friction that causes most beginners to quit before writing a single line. Ghostwriter can explain what code does and why it works — it\'s designed partly as a learning tool. GitHub Copilot autocompletes code at high speed, which can produce code you don\'t understand, undermining the learning process.' },

    metaDescription: 'Taskade vs Notion compared for freelancers, solopreneurs, and small teams. Real breakdown of AI features, project management, knowledge base capabilities, and pricing in 2026.',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Is Taskade better than Notion?', a: 'For execution and project management — getting tasks done, moving work forward, automating repetitive workflows — Taskade is better. Its AI agents generate project plans and run automations proactively. For knowledge management, documentation, and building complex interconnected information systems, Notion\'s flexibility is unmatched. The right choice depends on whether your biggest friction is doing work or organising knowledge.' },
      { q: 'Does Taskade have a free plan?', a: 'Yes. Taskade\'s free plan includes unlimited projects, basic collaboration, and 5 AI agent runs per month. Paid plans start at $8/month per workspace. Notion also has a free plan (unlimited pages, limited collaboration features, 7-day history). Notion AI is a $10/month add-on to any Notion plan.' },
      { q: 'What are Taskade AI agents?', a: 'Taskade AI agents are custom AI assistants assigned to specific projects. You can create agents that automatically generate project plans from a goal description, draft task content, summarise project status for weekly reports, or run other repetitive workflows inside your workspace. They run inside your projects and have access to your task data — unlike generic AI chatbots.' },
      { q: 'Can Taskade replace Notion?', a: 'For most project management and team collaboration use cases, yes. Taskade covers task management, AI-assisted planning, real-time collaboration, and basic documentation. For complex knowledge management — interconnected databases, research wikis, custom CRMs — Notion\'s flexibility and database features are significantly more powerful and Taskade would feel limiting.' },
      { q: 'Which productivity tool is better for solopreneurs and freelancers?', a: 'Taskade is typically better for solopreneurs and freelancers who want to move fast. The AI project scaffolding, built-in agent automation, and lower setup overhead mean you spend more time doing work and less time building your productivity system. Notion requires more upfront setup but offers more long-term flexibility as your workflows grow in complexity.' },
